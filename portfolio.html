        <h2>Description of game</h2>
        
        <p>
            Our game is about trying to catch the apples using the bowl.  You can move your<br>
            bowl by using the arrow keys.  Later on the game, as you get a higher<br>
            score an elephant and a penguin will drop down.  You can not catch the<br>
            animals because it will decrease your score.  As you collect the apples,<br>
            your score will increase by 5 points.  The use of randomness occurs <br>
            when the apples, elephant, and penguin spawns at different places on top<br>
            of the screen.  The games increases in difficulty when you get a score<br>
            higher than 100 and the elephants start dropping down quickly.  If you<br>
            catch the elephant, it decreases your score by 5.  Later, the penguin<br>
            will drop down.  If you catch a penguin, you will lose instantly.<br>
            To win, you would have to get a score of 200.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            My partner and I created this game because of another game called<br> 
            Flappy Mario on scratch.  Two successful points in the development<br>
            process of our game was how we got the sprites or characters to fall down.<br>
            Another successful process was how we got to make the bowl move and<br>
            catch the sprites.  Two obstacles in the development was the point system<br>
            and how the sprites kept on glitching on top of the screen.  We overcame<br>
            this obstacle by asking the teacher for help, which was very helpful.<br>
            If we had more time on our game project, we would have made a pause button.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            This is an algorithm that we used to make the bowl move.  This algorithm<br>
            makes the apple spawn at different places at the top of the screen.

        <a href = "#adventure">My Adventure Story On Python</a><br>
        <p>
            In my story, it basically talks about how there is a monster who is<br>
            holding captive to a man's, Cook, daughter.  So the adventure begins<br>
            by you choosing to help your daughter or leave her.  Also, make sure<br>
            you press run.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            My partner and I did not have any incremental development, but we did<br>
            have a interative development.  One interative development was when<br>
            the computer asks you to choose a letter such as a or b, you would have<br>
            to choose those letters or the computer would not let you continue the story.<br>
            The difficulties my partner and I had was that we could not sometimes figure<br>
            out how to make the story flow better.  To fix this, we looked at our<br>
            teacher's program for refrence.  I believe that organizing your program<br>
            into functions is a form of procedural abstraction because it makes<br>
            the program easier to read.<br>There was a story that I had read in class<br>
            that I enjoyed.  I do not recall the name, but I enjoyed it because<br>
            if you chose the wrong path, you would have to restart.<br>
